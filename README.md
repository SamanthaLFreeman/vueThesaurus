# vue-thesaurus

A take home challenge, where I was expected to create a single-page application in Vue.js that allows users to find synonyms for a word they search. A user can click on one of these synonyms, which will take them to a new word and so on. I had half a week to complete this project using a framework (Vue) that I hadn't previously utilzed.

### Setup

1. Clone down repo `git clone <url>`
2. cd into directory
3. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
4. Run `npm run serve` to view on localhost:8080
